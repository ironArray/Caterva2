Announcing Caterva2 2025.10.25
==============================

Caterva2 is a high-performance storage and computation system for
Blosc2 and HDF5 data repositories.

This is a major release, where we are freezing the API and bumping the
package to Production/Stable status.  That means that from now on, we will
only do backward-compatible changes to the API, and we will focus on
stability and performance improvements.

This release includes several new features, performance improvements,
and bug fixes.
